# React Native Timetracker App

A simple React Native app for tracking work time â€” inspired by toggle-style time trackers.  
The goal is to build a lightweight tool I can use day-to-day to start, stop, and review work sessions.  

## Project Goals
- Create an MVP with start/stop timer and local session storage.  
- Provide a session history view to track daily and weekly work.  
- Add useful features over time such as export/api integrations.
